This is some content.

[shortcode]with content[/shortcode]

Some shortcodes are self-closing
like this one: [closer /]

We can also embed some links such
as for http://youtube.com/watch?v=23581038.

Here is a video:
[youtube a23409t58hg]

Another [variant name="test" /] is the slash end '/]'

[tags] can contain text [/tags]

And then again, we can have attributes
[gallery disabled ids="1,2,3,4"]

[nested]
Some tags are
[nested] but that doesn't work[/nested]
 too well
[/nested]

[another]tag can [be]nested[/be] without trouble[/another]

If we want to display the shortcode itself, we
just need to [[quote]] it.

[[this short="code"]won't be processed[/this]]

[empty][/empty]
